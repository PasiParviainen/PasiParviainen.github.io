					<h1>Hi! I'm Pasi!</h1>
					<p>
						I'm 22 years old, and I live in Rusko, Finland.<br>
						Right now, my strongest programming languages are Flutter, HTML and CSS. 
						Also, ever since I was 16, I've built more than 10 gaming computers for my family and friends.<br>
					</p>
					<hr class="rounded">
					<h1> What kind of person am I?</h1>
					<p>
						I'm a carefree, relaxed (most of the time) and overall a positive person. I have a good sense 
						of humor (although a bit "unique"). Generally I'm a quick learner, and I usually get along 
						with people.

			<h1>What do I do on my free time?</h1>
			<p>
				Most of the time I play video games (Mostly Overwatch 2) with my friends, 
				but I also love hanging out with them face to face. 
				Most of my friends live far away, so we have our own Discord community server, which I'm the owner of.<br>
				I also go to the gym 1-3 times a week, and I'm currently trying to lose weight and gain muscle.
				I often find myself helping my friends with computer problems, and I'm always the guy who
				my friends turn to if they need a new PC.
				I've also recently gotten into 3D-modelling with Blender and 3D-printing.
			</p>
			<hr class="rounded">
			<h1>What are my biggest flaws?</h1>
			<p>
				My biggest downfall is anxiety, and the procrastination it brings with it. 
				New people, places and experiences often cause me a great deal of anxiety.<br>
				I also sometimes have trouble focusing on tasks, or if a task seems out of my scope, 
				I start procrastinating on it.<br>
				Its also difficult for me to ask help. I try my best to do things by myself, 
				yet for some reason I can't bring myself to ask for help when I'm struggling.<br>
				These are all issues I'm working on and trying to fix, but the road ahead is long.
